                <p>Welcome to my fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site,
                    it would be the ideal place to come learn about birdwatching. I 
                    am unfortunately somewhate afraid of birds, so I have had to learn 
                    to keep my eyes on them at all times. Here I will share my methods
                    with you! 
                </p>

                <p>So don't waste time! The birds are out there! Get what you need
                    and look out!
                </p>

                <p> Try to catch a bird by hovering over it with your mouse. Trust me; they are quite elusive.</p>
