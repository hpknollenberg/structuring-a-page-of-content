        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>Welcome to my fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site,
           it would be the ideal place to come learn about birdwatching. I 
           am unfortunately somewhate afraid of birds, so I have had to learn 
           to keep my eyes on them at all times. Here I will share my methods
           with you! 
        </p>

        <p>So don't waste time! The birds are out there! Get what you need
           and look out!
        </p>
